It's always useful to analyze excited states in QM calculations: electron-hole populations 
by molecular fragments to characterize the nature of the excited state, or having the descomposition
of the wavefunction in molecular fragments to set up populations of excitonic character along the 
participant molecules.

David Casanova & Anna Krylov have implemented the analysis in Q-Chem, based on the decomposition of the
RAS-Spin Flip (RAS-SF) wavefunction into three contributions by molecular fragments:

|PSI> = |LE> + |ME> + |CR>,

where LE, ME, and CR are Localized Excitations, Multiexcitonic character, and Charge Resonance Character.
It's been useful to characterize excited states for systems that can perform singlet fission or where a charge
transfer process is crucial for a reaction chemistry to happen. However, these type of analysis are only for single
point calculations, setting up only on-the-fly modelling when a dynamic process is studied.

Along with the wavefunction analysis, the radical character could be performed by different population analysis,
as the Yamaguchi model, for example (a fast approach is available at https://manual.q-chem.com/5.1/sect-odd_electron.html).

A good mid-long term goal could be setting up a method to study these population changes in dynamic calculations, no matter
the used method (QM, QM/MM), for having a better understanding of the molecular fragments and their changes in photophysical/photochemical
processes.
